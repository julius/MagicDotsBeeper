Magic Dots Beeper
==================

The Magic Dots Beeper is a little HTML5 file, which beeps every 6 minutes.
It helps you use the Magic Dots technique, which uses Quasi-Reinforcement to help get things done.
The idea is to draw a dot or a line on a paper every 6 minutes, while working on a task. This will give you a motivating feeling of progress.
